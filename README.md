# audioserve-rss

A basic Express application which queries the AudioServe API locally and returns an XML RSS Feed to be used with alternative applications instead of the offical AudioServe app. It requires AudioServe application to be ran with --no-authentication param.

## Use Case

The AudioServe web application is perfect for my needs, but the Android app wasn't too my taste. In order to use AudioServe accross mutliple devices, you need the shared key. But this cannot be emdedded into simple RSS feeds. This proxy allows RSS XML to be generated by querying the AudioServe API and returning all relative data. This feed can then be added to devices connected locally (eg Podcast Addict) and episodes downloaded in advance. If needed to connect externally, a tunnel can be made from a mobile device.

## Install and Use Standalone

Proxy can be ran standalone or built via the docker container.

For standalone, clone this repo

> npm install

> npm start
 
Which will run the rss.js file.

Please edit the rss.js to change to the relevant port you have associated with your main AduioServe program. Default Port is 3004

## Docker

Recommended

Note - Depending on your docker configuratation "ip.address()" may render your internal docker container IP not your host IP. This may need to be changed manually and container rebuilt if you encounter this error. Please edit the rss.js file to add the correct internal IP address.

> docker build -t nf88/audioserve-rss .
> docker run -d --name audioserve-rss -p 3005:3005 nf88/audioserve-rss:latest 

## Use

One container is running, get the foldernane of your respected AudioBook. Make sure this is the root directory containing all audio files.
